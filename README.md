# A-Language-First-Approach-to-Procedural-Planning
This is the official code repository for our paper: A Language First Approach to Procedural Planning.

#### Our Modularized Framework
![Our Modularized Framework: The Right part is a Double retrieval model which obtains both the start step and the end step with the input image and Textual prompt. The Left part is a finetuned language model based on ground truth steps, which is designed to predict the intermediate steps. We use the integration of these two models to do procedural planning task.](https://github.com/Lumos-Jiateng/A-Language-First-Approach-to-Procedural-Planning/blob/main/images/model_architecture_double_infer-page1.jpg)
